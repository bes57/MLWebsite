### I am Benjamin Sherman

As an undergraduate student at Duke University studying Statistical Science and History, Iâ€™m passionate about data science, machine learning, and using R to explore complex questions through research and reproducible analysis. In this practice, I use tools like Quarto and RMarkdown to ensure that everything I build is transparent, well-documented, and easy to follow. 

Outside of statistics, some of my interests include jazz piano, bowling, climbing, and college basketball.
